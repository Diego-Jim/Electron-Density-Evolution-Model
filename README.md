# Electron-Density-Evolution-Model

#This code simulates the electron density build up during L-H transitions in plasmas based on a fluid continuity model.
#The aim of this project is to extract the transport coeficients that govern the density profile change.
#Additionaly work is currently under way to train a neujral network to find these coefficients faster and more effectively.
